    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled, quartered, and sliced into 1/4-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried mint, divided</li>
        <li>1/2 cup mild olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>1 large red onion, diced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup diced red bell pepper</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/3 cup lemon juice, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 cup thinly sliced green onions</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh mint</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh Italian parsley</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon Aleppo chili flakes</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Transfer sliced potatoes into a large pot with enough cold water to cover the potatoes by a couple of inches. Stir in 1 rounded tablespoon kosher salt and 2 ½ teaspoons dried mint. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium and let cook until tender, about 15 minutes, checking every 5 to 6 minutes for doneness. Drain well.</li>
        <li>Transfer cooked potatoes to a large mixing bowl and let cool slightly.</li>
        <li>While potatoes cool, heat ¼ cup olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add red onion, red bell pepper, garlic, and a pinch of salt; cook and stir for just 1 minute. Turn off the heat and stir in remaining dried mint.</li>
        <li>Drizzle freshly squeezed lemon juice into potatoes and toss gently with a spatula. Add green onions, red onion mixture, remaining olive oil, fresh mint, fresh parsley, salt to taste, black pepper, chili flakes, and cayenne. Mix with a spatula until combined.</li>
        <li>Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled and flavors have melded, 3 to 4 hours. </li>
        <li>Unwrap; stir, taste, and adjust seasonings as needed to personal tastes. The salad almost always needs more salt stirred in once it's tasted after being chilled. Serve.</li>
    </ol>
